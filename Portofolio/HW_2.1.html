					<h2>Immuno-Oncology</h2>
						<p>Cancer immunotherapy (immuno-oncology) is the use of the immune system to treat cancer.<br />
						Immunotherapies fall into three main groups: cellular, antibody and cytokine.</p>

							<p>"The <strong>Hallmarks of Cancer</strong>" is a seminal peer-reviewed article published in the journal Cell<br />
							in January 2000 by the <strong>cancer</strong> researchers Douglas Hanahan and Robert Weinberg. The authors<br />
							believe that the complexity of <strong>cancer</strong> can be reduced to a small number of underlying principles.<br /> 
							The paper argues that all cancers share six common traits ("hallmarks") that govern the<br /> transformation of normal
							cells to cancer (malignant or tumor) cells.
					<h3>The Hallmarks of Cancer Underlying Principles</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Cancer cells stimulate their own growth (Self-sufficiency in growth signals);</li>
							<li>They resist inhibitory signals that might otherwise stop their growth (Insensitivity to anti-growth signals);</li>
							<li>They resist their programmed cell death (Evading apoptosis);</li>
							<li>They can multiply indefinitely (Limitless replicative potential);</li>
							<li>They stimulate the growth of blood vessels to supply nutrients to tumors (Sustained angiogenesis);</li>
							<li>They invade local tissue and spread to distant sites (Tissue invasion and metastasis).</li>
						</ol>
